Environmental impact with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
The world is changing around us every day. The air is being polluted by vehicles and factories. AI can solve this problem. In the future, self driving cars will not use gasoline and will be good for the environment. AI can reduce air pollution in the world.
## Background
Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
Cars will not use gasoline and will be good for the environment. This problem is very frequent. My personal motivitation is a book about air pollution. This topic is important because if there is too much pollution, it could be unhealthy for the world.
## How is it used?
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
AI will take over many jobs and people will use electricity more often. This solution is needed in environmental situations. The users are people.
## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
My data comes from myself.
## Challenges
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
My project doesn't solve the fact that people will still pollute the air. This solution will only reduce air pollution, but not make it stop entirely.
## What next?
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
My project could grow and become something even more by getting people more involved in the environment. I would need people who can code AI really well to move on.
